-Got rid of robotTrajectory.m

(THIS MUST HAPPEN IN BEGINNING TO MAKE END TO END PLOT WORK)
-Time update happens in beginning
-Encoder update happens in beginning
-Index update happens in beginning

-do not pre-initialize zeros. Makes plot ugly.
-plot information ONLY AT END to speed up processing

-fixed time initialization
-set t = 0 beginning. No NaN errors.

-reorganized loop to make work

-added labels to plot
-added title to plot

-renamed cubicspiral plot() function to plotData() to prevent recursion

-added my own plotting function to get end-to-end simulated plotting to work
